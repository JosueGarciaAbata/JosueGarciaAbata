👋 Hi there!

I'm Josué Joel García Abata.
🎓 Currently studying Software Engineering at Universidad Técnica de Ambato.

💻 I'm very interested in back-end development, although I occasionally practice front-end as well.

☕ My favorite programming language is Java, and I’m currently learning Spring Framework 6 & Spring Boot 3.
