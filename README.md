ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm JosuÃ© Joel GarcÃ­a Abata.

ðŸŽ“ Currently studying Software Engineering at Universidad TÃ©cnica de Ambato.

ðŸ’» I'm very interested in back-end development, although I occasionally practice front-end as well.

â˜• My favorite programming language is Java, and Iâ€™m currently learning Spring Framework 6 & Spring Boot 3.

Here are some projects I have worked:

- [Data Structures] (https://github.com/JosueGarciaAbata/proyecto-edd): Data Structures
- [Blog] (https://github.com/JosueGarciaAbata/proyecto-mds): A blog
